In this task, multiple HTML files were created for different sections of the site, such as the home page, about page, and experience page. The same navigation bar was reused across all pages to maintain consistency, and relative paths were used to link the pages correctly.

A single CSS file was linked to all pages so that styles remain consistent throughout the site. The active navigation link was highlighted using a CSS class to indicate the current page, helping users understand where they are while navigating.

This task helped reinforce concepts such as multi-page navigation, reuse of styles, relative linking, and maintaining consistent layout across multiple pages.
